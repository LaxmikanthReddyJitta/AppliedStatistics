## Dataset

The analysis is based on the Car_sales.csv dataset, which contains various attributes of car sales, such as price, engine size, horsepower, and more.


**Description:** 

I) **Price in Thousands:** Represents the price of the car in thousands of dollars.

II) **Engine Size:** The size of the car's engine, typically measured in liters.

III) **Horsepower:** The power output of the car's engine, measured in horsepower.

IV) **Wheelbase:** The distance between the front and rear wheels of the car, usually measured in inches.

V) **Width, Length:** The dimensions of the car, indicating its size.

VI) **Curb Weight:** The weight of the car without passengers or cargo, measured in pounds.

VII) **Fuel Capacity:** The amount of fuel the car's tank can hold, typically measured in gallons.

VIII) **Fuel Efficiency:** The car's efficiency in fuel consumption, usually measured in miles per gallon (MPG).

IX) **Power Performance Factor:** A calculated metric that combines several attributes to represent the car's overall performance.

X) **Resale Value:** The estimated value of the car after one year, indicating its depreciation.

These features provide a comprehensive view of the cars' specifications, performance, and market value, making the dataset suitable for various statistical analyses and modeling tasks related to car sales.
